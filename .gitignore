### `.gitignore`

This file is very important. It prevents you from accidentally committing your video stream files (`hls/`) or Python cache files to a Git repository.

Create a new file named `.gitignore` (with the `.` at the beginning) in your main project folder.

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
*.egg-info/
.env

# Project-specific: IGNORE ALL STREAM FILES
/hls/

# Private file
cookies.txt
*.cookie
